The information will be sent to the cloud NPNG application, and will be available from any webbrowser.

From there, the possibilities are endless: 
  * you could run a fat client application on your computer to prevent you from playing video games if your room is not tidy,
  * you could configure the application to send an SMS or call you on your cellphone to remind you of the cleaning work that needs to be done.
  * A lot of exciting features have yet to be implemented, but since the code is free and open source, fully available on GitHub, who knows where it could go with help from the community!
